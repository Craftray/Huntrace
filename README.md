##Huntrace

### What exactly is Huntrace?


Huntrace is a hunter game plugin designed for Paper 1.17 and above.

Currently, this project is in pre-alpha state, which means it is literally unstable and will lead into many serious bugs, including crashes and data-losing.

You should not use this plugin in any production server, and should back up properly if you want to test and try this plugin.

### So, what are the features of Huntrace?

First at all, Huntrace is designed to be totally configurable inside the server. Player who create the game should be able to change almost any game settings.

At the current stage, we have the following settings which are configurable in game:

- Compass rule, including interval of updates, whether to deceive the compass, and ability to track across dimensions

- World rule, world's type, seed, and whether to generate structures

And sure, there will be more settings in the future.

### Is there any known issues now?

Of course, yes. The biggest problem for now is that generate the three dimensions of a game will lag the whole server for about 15 seconds, which is certainly unacceptable.

As the warning above, you should not use this plugin in any production environment.
